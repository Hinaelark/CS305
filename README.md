The client, Artemis Financial, was a company that provides individualized financial plans for its customers.  They wanted to modernize their systems and update the security for their restful web api.  It is important to code securely because businesses lose customers when their reputation is poor and one quick way to get a negative reputation is if your customer's data becomes compromised in a security breach.  One of the biggest problems in doing the vulnerability assessments for this course was dealing with problems caused by outdated code that wouoldn't work in newer versions of Java.  As for making sure that I didn't introduce new vulnerabilities, I compared the number of vulnerabilities detected from the dependency check with the number detected after I completed adding code to the project and made sure that the number of vulnerabilities didn't increase.  As far as things that I will use in the future, both spring and the dependency check tool were easy to use and quickly produced dependable and helpful results.
